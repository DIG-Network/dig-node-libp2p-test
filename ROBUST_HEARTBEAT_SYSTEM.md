# Robust Heartbeat and Re-Registration System

## 🎯 **Enhanced Heartbeat Strategy**

Yes! The DIG heartbeat system now includes **intelligent re-registration** with multiple fallback scenarios to ensure peers eventually re-register even if initial registration fails.

## 🔄 **Re-Registration Triggers**

### **1. Heartbeat-Based Re-Registration**
```typescript
// Every 2 minutes during heartbeat
if (response.status === 404) {
  // Peer not found - re-register immediately
  this.logger.info('🔄 Peer not found - re-registering...')
  return await this.useAWSBootstrapFallback()
}
```

### **2. Server Error Recovery**
```typescript
if (response.status >= 500) {
  // Server error - might be restart, try re-registration
  this.logger.warn('⚠️ Server error - attempting re-registration...')
  return await this.useAWSBootstrapFallback()
}
```

### **3. Network Error Recovery**
```typescript
catch (error) {
  if (error.name === 'AbortError' || error.message.includes('fetch')) {
    this.logger.debug('🌐 Network error - attempting re-registration...')
    return await this.useAWSBootstrapFallback()
  }
}
```

### **4. Consecutive Failure Recovery**
```typescript
let consecutiveFailures = 0
const maxFailures = 3

if (consecutiveFailures >= maxFailures) {
  this.logger.info('🔄 Multiple failures - full re-registration...')
  const reregistered = await this.useAWSBootstrapFallback()
  if (reregistered) consecutiveFailures = 0
}
```

### **5. Peer Discovery Re-Registration**
```typescript
// During discoverAllPeers() if peer count < 3
const registered = await this.useAWSBootstrapFallback()
if (!registered) {
  this.logger.warn('⚠️ Registration failed - will retry on next heartbeat')
}
```

## 📊 **Complete Failure Recovery Matrix**

| Scenario | Heartbeat Response | Action | Retry Logic |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Peer not found** | 404 | ✅ Immediate re-registration | Next heartbeat |
| **Server restart** | 500+ | ✅ Immediate re-registration | Next heartbeat |
| **Network timeout** | Timeout/Error | ✅ Immediate re-registration | Next heartbeat |
| **Rate limiting** | 429 | ⏳ Wait (cost protection) | Next heartbeat |
| **3+ consecutive fails** | Any failure | ✅ Full re-registration | Reset counter |
| **Low peer count** | N/A | ✅ Re-registration attempt | During discovery |

## ⏰ **Timing Strategy**

### **Heartbeat Frequency**
- **Every 2 minutes** - keeps registration fresh
- **10-minute timeout** - 5x safety margin
- **Immediate re-registration** on failure

### **Failure Handling**
- **Consecutive failure tracking** - detects persistent issues
- **Progressive escalation** - tries re-registration after 3 failures
- **Automatic recovery** - resets counters on success

### **Multiple Entry Points**
- **Startup registration** - initial registration attempt
- **Heartbeat re-registration** - handles 404, 500+, network errors
- **Discovery re-registration** - ensures registration during peer discovery
- **Failure escalation** - full re-registration after consecutive failures

## 🛡️ **Resilience Features**

### **1. Bootstrap Server Restart Recovery**
```
Bootstrap Server Restarts → DIG Node heartbeat gets 500 error → 
Immediate re-registration → Peer appears in new server instance
```

### **2. Network Connectivity Recovery**
```
Network Outage → Heartbeat timeouts → Re-registration attempts → 
Network restored → Successful re-registration → Peer active again
```

### **3. Cost Throttling Awareness**
```
Bootstrap in throttle mode → Heartbeat gets 429 → 
DIG Node waits patiently → Throttling ends → Normal heartbeat resumes
```

### **4. Registration Failure Recovery**
```
Initial registration fails → Heartbeat system continues trying → 
Eventually succeeds → Peer becomes active
```

## 🔄 **Bootstrap Server Cleanup Strategy**

### **On-Demand Cleanup (Primary)**
- **New registration** → Clean expired peers → Add new peer
- **Heartbeat received** → Clean expired peers → Update timestamp
- **TURN registration** → Clean expired peers → Register capability

### **Periodic Cleanup (Backup)**
- **Every 15 minutes** → Clean any missed expired peers
- **Reduced frequency** → Primary cleanup is event-driven
- **Safety net** → Catches edge cases

## 📈 **Expected Behavior**

### **Normal Operation**
```
DIG Node → Registers → Heartbeat every 2min → Stays in peer list
```

### **Registration Failure**
```
DIG Node → Registration fails → Heartbeat tries re-registration → Eventually succeeds
```

### **Bootstrap Server Restart**
```
Bootstrap restarts → Peer list empty → DIG heartbeat gets 404 → 
Re-registers immediately → Peer list populated again
```

### **Network Issues**
```
Network down → Heartbeats fail → Network restored → 
Next heartbeat re-registers → Peer active again
```

## ✅ **Answer to Your Question**

**Yes!** The DIG heartbeat system now includes comprehensive re-registration:

1. **✅ Immediate re-registration** on 404 (peer not found)
2. **✅ Server restart recovery** on 500+ errors  
3. **✅ Network error recovery** on timeouts/fetch errors
4. **✅ Consecutive failure escalation** after 3 failures
5. **✅ Discovery-time re-registration** during peer discovery
6. **✅ Cost-aware handling** of 429 throttling responses

The system is now **extremely resilient** - if registration fails for any reason, the heartbeat system will keep trying different recovery strategies until it eventually succeeds! 🛡️🔄
